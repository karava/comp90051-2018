Extension activities\n","* Experiment with using different built-in optimizers (e.g. `tf.train.AdamOptimizer`) and/or step sizes. Does the rate of convergence vary?\n","* Try setting up TensorBoard (a web-app that allows you to view the graph and visualize metrics during training).\n","* Adapt the code in this notebook to implement linear regression (it should only require minimal changes). You'll need to import data that's appropriate for regression."]}]}
